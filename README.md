# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data science and ML**


Traveling without road signs is like conducting data science without exploratory data analysis (EDA). Without EDA, a data scientist might stumble upon a great prediction model, but it would be purely by chance: akin to taking the correct turn without any information whatsoever.

Despite the obvious risks of embarking on a data science project without EDA, this is regrettably common, especially among beginners. Hence, it's crucial for novices to grasp fundamental EDA techniques early on and consistently apply them in every project, no matter how minor.

Ease the data science journey by putting up figurative road signs through effective EDA. In this hands-on guided project, we learn how to conduct simple and easy-to-remember EDA using Python. we also learn how to apply the insights obtained by using EDA for the purposes of enhancing a prediction model.
